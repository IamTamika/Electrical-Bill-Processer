# Electrical-Bill-Processer

Project Description

I was asked to create an application that processes electricity bills for multiple customers. 
For now,customers’ data will be just stored in the application. 
In other words, each time the application executes, it will start from scratch.

For each customer, electricity bill is calculated based on number of kWh as follows:
• There is an administrative charge of $12.
• In addition, for each kWh used there a charge of $0.07.

For each customer, the following data is stored:
• AccountNo – an int value,
• FirstName and LastName – string values,
• Number of kWh used – a decimal number, and
• BillAmount – a decimal number.

The application will create and store multiple objects that contain customers’ data. It will also keep
track of the following statistics:
• Number of customers processed,
• Total number of kWh used,
• Average bill amount

When adding a new customer, user enters FirstName and LastName and kWh used. All entries
must be provided, and kWh has to be a non-negative number.
AccountNo can be either generated by the application or entered by the user. If it is entered by
the user, the application should check for uniqueness.
